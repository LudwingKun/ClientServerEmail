# ClientServerEmail
Written in java, it uses java Socket for the communication between the client and the Server.

LogIn doesn't realize a connection with the server, it simply write on a Xml file the new User, so if you want to test only the LogIn interface you don't have to start Server. The Server when it os started read frome the same XML file where the LoginController has write the users.


START THE APP: you have to start ServerApp, and ClientApp, you can start as many Client as you want. now you can use your Client to chat with other Client, or even send email to yourself.
